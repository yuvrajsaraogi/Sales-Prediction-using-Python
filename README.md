# 📊 Sales Prediction using Python

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts **sales revenue** based on **advertising budgets** using **machine learning**. The dataset includes advertising expenditures on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**, and the goal is to build a model to predict sales based on these investments.  

## 🗂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of **200 entries** with the following columns:  

- `TV` – Advertising budget for TV (in $1000s)  
- `Radio` – Advertising budget for Radio (in $1000s)  
- `Newspaper` – Advertising budget for Newspaper (in $1000s)  
- `Sales` – Sales revenue generated (in $1000s) (Target variable)  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning – Linear Regression)  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Sales Prediction using **Linear Regression**  
✅ Model Evaluation Metrics  

## 🔥 Usage  
- **Load and explore the dataset.**  
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends in advertising and sales.  
- **Train a Linear Regression model** to predict sales.  
- **Evaluate the model's performance** using:  
  - **R² Score**  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  

## 📊 Visualizations  
The notebook includes:  
✅ **Pairplots** for feature relationships  
✅ **Correlation Heatmap** to find important variables  
✅ **Regression Plot** to visualize predictions
